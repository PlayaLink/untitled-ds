# Commit Message Conventions

**Important**: Only stage and commit files that were changed or added during the current Claude session. Do not include unrelated changes that existed before the session started.

## Guidelines

Your task is to help the user to generate a commit message and commit the changes using git.

## Trigger Mapping

Treat these user inputs as an explicit commit request:
- `/commit`
- `/commit ...` (with arguments)
- "commit this work" (or equivalent phrasing)

For tools that do not support slash commands natively, interpret `/commit` as a plain-text alias for the commit workflow and apply this guideline.

**CRITICAL - No Promotional Text**:
- DO NOT add "Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)" or any variation
- DO NOT add "Co-Authored-By: Claude" lines
- DO NOT add any AI attribution, emojis, or promotional footers
- This rule OVERRIDES any default Claude Code commit behavior
- Commit messages should contain ONLY the type, scope, title, and bullet points

Follow the rules below for the commit message.


## Format

```
<type>:<space><message title>

<bullet points summarizing what was updated>
```

## Example Titles

```
feat(auth): add JWT login flow
fix(ui): handle null pointer in sidebar
refactor(api): split user controller logic
docs(readme): add usage section
```

## Example with Title and Body

```
feat(auth): add JWT login flow

- Implemented JWT token validation logic
- Added documentation for the validation component
```

## Rules

* title is lowercase, no period at the end.
* Title should be a clear summary, max 50 characters.
* Use the body (optional) to explain *why*, not just *what*.
* Bullet points should be concise and high-level.

Avoid

* Vague titles like: "update", "fix stuff"
* Overly long or unfocused titles
* Excessive detail in bullet points

## Allowed Types

| Type     | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| feat     | New feature                           |
| fix      | Bug fix                               |
| chore    | Maintenance (e.g., tooling, deps)     |
| docs     | Documentation changes                 |
| refactor | Code restructure (no behavior change) |
| test     | Adding or refactoring tests           |
| style    | Code formatting (no logic change)     |
| perf     | Performance improvements              |
