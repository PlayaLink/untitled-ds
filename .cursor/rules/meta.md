## Cursor Rules Maintenance

When making changes that affect workflows, conventions, or processes documented in `.cursor/rules/`, update the corresponding rule file to reflect the new reality.

- **`.cursor/rules/`** - Conventions that apply when editing specific file types (via globs) or always (via alwaysApply)
- **`.claude/commands/`** - Workflows invoked explicitly via slash commands
